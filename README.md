#### COVID-19 Salivary Protein Profile ü•ºüë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª
We developed a hybrid proteomics and in silico interactomics strategy to establish a COVID-19 salivary protein profile. The differential proteome was narrowed down by the Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis and enrichment analysis was performed with FunRich. In parallel, OralInt was used to determine interspecies Protein-Protein Interactions between humans and SARS-CoV-2. Five dysregulated biological processes were identified in the COVID-19 proteome profile: Apoptosis, Energy Pathways, Immune Response, Protein Metabolism and Transport. We identified 10 proteins (KLK 11, IMPA2, ANXA7, PLP2, IGLV2-11, IGHV3-43D, IGKV2-24, TMEM165, VSIG10 and PHB2) that had never been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, representing new evidence of the impact of COVID-19. Interactomics analysis showed viral influence on the host immune response, mainly through interaction with the degranulation of neutrophils. The virus alters the host‚Äôs energy metabolism and interferes with apoptosis mechanisms.

#### CoVTec in Saliva - Diagnosis of COVID 19 in saliva ü•ºüë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª
CoVTec aims to develop protocols for saliva processing, SARS-CoV-2 virus detection and host immune response assessment adapted to this fluid. The CoVTec project allowed the implementation of an R&DT platform to support the various SNS institutions in the Viseu (Portugal) region, focusing on diagnostic strategies to respond to this and future pandemics.
We have developed a platform to collect patient data, randomizing the patient data and offering a streamline operation from Medical staff in the Hospital to the Laboratory personal to have access to real time data and accessible according to the roles pre-defined.
