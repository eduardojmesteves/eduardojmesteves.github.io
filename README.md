### **Projects**

#### Disease risk prediction in the tip of the finger üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíªü•º

Alongside [Prana-Tech](https://prana-tech.co.uk/about_us) we aim to develop and apply Machine-Learning methods to multiple disease cnditions and merge into a user-centric health app.

Technologies | Data analysis, Biostatistics, Machine-Learning.
Roles | Bioinformatician
Status | Ongoing since September 2023

#### Oral Microbiome profile in Clear Aligner Patients During Treatment üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíªü¶∑

The analysis of NGS microbial hypervariable regions of 16S rDNA focused on evaluating bacterial species diversity within samples using alpha diversity metrics like Shannon, Simpson, and Chao1. These metrics assess species richness and evenness (Shannon and Simpson) or species richness alone (Chao1). The study compared diversity in different sample types (saliva and biofilm) and between initial (T0) and final (T2 or T3) treatment time points to observe changes in microbial communities over time.

- Output: PhD thesis presented by Dr. Pedro C. Lopes', titled "Oral Microbiota in Caries Prevention, Diagnosis and Management - Challenges and Opportunities"

#### COVID-19 Salivary Protein Profile ü•ºüë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª

This study combined proteomics and in silico interactomics to generate a salivary protein profile for COVID-19. Techniques such as partial least squares discriminant analysis and enrichment analysis with FunRich were used to narrow down the differential proteome. OralInt was used to investigate protein-protein interactions between the host and SARS-CoV-2. The analysis identified five dysregulated biological processes in COVID-19: apoptosis, energy pathways, immune response, protein metabolism and transport. Ten proteins not previously associated with SARS-CoV-2 were discovered, revealing new aspects of the virus' effects. The study also showed that SARS-CoV-2 affects the host's immune response, energy metabolism and apoptosis mechanisms.

#### CoVTec in Saliva - Diagnosis of COVID 19 in saliva ü•ºüë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª

The CoVTec project focuses on developing protocols for processing saliva, detecting SARS-CoV-2, and assessing the host immune response using saliva samples. It has established an R&DT platform to support healthcare institutions in the Viseu region of Portugal, enhancing diagnostic strategies for current and future pandemics. The project also created a platform for real-time data collection and randomization, enabling streamlined operations and controlled data access for medical staff and laboratory personnel based on pre-defined roles.

#### SalivaPRINT Toolkit ‚Äì Protein profile evaluation and phenotype stratification ü•ºüë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª

SalivaPRINT Toolkit enables the analysis of protein profile patterns by the identification of molecular weight ranges altered in a particular condition and therefore potentially involved in the underlying dysregulated mechanisms. SalivaPRINT Toolkit is a CLI for electrophoretic protein profile evaluation.

Technologies | Python in software development and in data analysis.
